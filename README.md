## üßê Projects

### üöÄ Machine Learning & AI

#### ‚ú® AI Text Classification ‚Äì Human vs Machine-Generated Text Detection

Developed a binary text classification system that distinguishes between human-written and AI-generated content using a hybrid model. Combined traditional machine learning (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) with deep learning (BiLSTM and Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks). Implemented a majority voting ensemble to enhance generalizability and robustness to class imbalance. The model achieved **92.45% accuracy** and secured a **Top 10 rank on the Kaggle Leaderboard**.
**Skills:** PyTorch, NLP, Ensemble Learning, DANN, TF-IDF, SMOTE

#### ‚ú® Early Sepsis Detection in ICU Patients

Built deep learning models to detect early signs of sepsis in ICU patients using MIMIC-IV data. Applied Sepsis-1 criteria and digital phenotyping to label time-series data. Implemented and compared LSTM, GRU, and RNN models, achieving **AUC of 0.90** and **81.8% accuracy**. Preprocessing included hourly data resampling, normalization, and missing value handling.
**Skills:** LSTM, GRU, RNN, BigQuery, ETL, Clinical Data Analysis

#### ‚ú® AI Agents for Competitive Azul Gameplay

Created three intelligent agents for Azul using Q-learning, Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search. Conducted performance evaluation under adversarial gameplay and time constraints. The Minimax agent achieved an **18/20 win rate**, with an average score of **60.75**, outperforming other models in accuracy and efficiency.
**Skills:** Reinforcement Learning, Search Algorithms, Simulation, Game AI

#### ‚ú® Heuristic Search & Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF)

Developed a custom heuristic-based food search agent for maze navigation that reduced node expansions from 4,137 to **134 nodes**. Designed and implemented Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to manage multiple agents in a shared environment, handling vertex and edge conflicts using STOP actions and replanning logic.
**Skills:** A\*, CBS, Heuristic Design, Pathfinding Optimization

#### ‚ú® Patient Sentiment Analysis from Textual Reviews

Explored the effect of feature engineering on classifier performance by analyzing patient feedback. Applied Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models. Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Found that Logistic Regression with L1 regularization and Count Vectorizer gave the highest performance (\~90%).
**Skills:** Text Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, NLP, Model Evaluation

#### ‚ú® Automated Fact-Checking System for Climate Science

Designed a two-stage NLP system to fact-check climate science claims. Used BM25 for evidence retrieval and BiLSTM + Attention for claim classification. Achieved **53% development accuracy** and **49.35% test accuracy**. Focused on classifying claims as supported, refuted, or unverifiable.
**Skills:** NLP, BM25, BiLSTM, GRU, Attention Mechanism, Climate Science
